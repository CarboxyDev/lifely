# Note from Developer

As I reflect upon my first ever javascript project after gaining decent exposure to javascript, I do realize how inefficient the code is and how poorly it has been written so sorry if you go through any trouble in the code! 
A major redesign may take place in the future.

This project has been completed , finished and terminated on 19 May 2020. Few minor changes or updates may follow though!

Minor changes done in Nov 2020.
