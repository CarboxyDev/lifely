## What is this game ?

Lifely is a text-based life simulator in which you live a completely random life by making decisions of your own. You start off as an 18 year old adult in a random country with random features. Most randomly generated people have similar inital health and morale but can have very different intellect and looks. 

You can do anything you want - from good deeds to evil sins. Everything has its repurcussions and your life will turn out the way you mould it.

A huge chunk of this game operates on pseudo-randomly generated numbers so any event can take place on its own at any random moment. You can be in an accident any moment or catch a deadly disease. This simulator can surprise you any moment.

The main aim of the game is to live a life as you want. You can lead a well-lived successful life or a normal middle-class life or even a thug's life who commits a lot of crimes!
It's all based on how you decide to play Lifely. In the end, it results in a wonderful simulated experience which you'll love playing!

## How do I play Lifely ?

Playing Lifely for the first time can be a bit overwhelming. There's a lot of stuff to do but no tutorials. You'll slowly and eventually have to figure out everything in this simulator. The game functions on a month to month basis which means that you age up a month on the click of a button.


Traditionally , it's recommended that you either get a job at start or study in a college if you want to. There are a lot of activities which you can do every month while doing either. Getting a job or going to a college isn't necessary though. You can live your life committing crimes or smugling drugs. It totally depends on you.


The simulator shows you your attributes on the right. They're very important and should be taken care of while you live your life. Having low health could invite death or having low morale could make you depressed.

## Latest note from developer
[Update: 04/18/21]

Lifely recently had a huge revamp where I completely changed the design and the code. Almost every piece of code was rewritten inspired by the old (and rusty) version of Lifely.

~~As of now, my plan is to add some more features and make this game better before going on a break from Lifely. More features will probably come in the future.~~

[Update: 01/22/22]
Lifely has been out of development for quite some time now. The latest release might be very unstable. 

[Update: 11/22/22]
Lifely has been deployed using vercel on my [personal website](https://carboxy.me).
Also, I must mention here that I have no immediate plans of updating Lifely. If any plans for an update do brew up, they'll be done in a separate repository until they're production-ready.
